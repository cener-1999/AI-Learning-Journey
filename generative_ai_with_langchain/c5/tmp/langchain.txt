LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:

Development: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source building blocks, components, and third-party integrations. Use LangGraph to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.
Productionization: Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
Deployment: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Cloud.

Concretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries:

langchain-core: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
langchain-community: Third party integrations.
Partner packages (e.g. langchain-openai, langchain-anthropic, etc.): Some integrations have been further split into their own lightweight packages that only depend on langchain-core.
langchain: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
LangGraph: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph. Integrates smoothly with LangChain, but can be used without it.
LangServe: Deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs.
LangSmith: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications.
